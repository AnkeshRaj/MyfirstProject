 This is my first project ,currently my intrest is in image processing and i am using matlab as my platform for this project.
 this project is based on image segmentation and labeling of objests and segmenting them out from the original image.
 calcualting its charectrestics and properties .
 the coins are segmented from background and their radius is calculated .
 the total no of coins is calculated using labeling and the amount is calculated using unique redius of each coin.
